# 🚀 Lab 4: Enterprise Scale – Scaling Deployments with Approval Gates

### Estimated Duration: 75 minutes

## Lab Scenario

You are a Power Platform developer at Contoso Ltd. As the organization scales app development across multiple teams, it becomes essential to add governance and oversight to production deployments. To support enterprise-grade ALM, leadership has mandated that all deployments to the production environment go through an approval process. In this lab, you will enhance your existing deployment pipeline by adding a pre-deployment approval gate and build an automated Power Automate flow to handle approval requests, ensuring that production deployments are reviewed and authorized by designated approvers.

## Lab Objective

In this lab, you will go through only one task:

- Extend the previous pipeline with Approvals

## ☑️ Task : Extend the previous pipeline with Approvals

### Task 1.1 : Extending the pipeline in the Deployment Pipeline Configuration App

In this task, you will learn how to extend the pipeline and add an approval before deploying to production.

1. Go to the [maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com).

2. Make sure you're in the **Prod** environment; if you're not, switch to it.

    ![](./assets/bs122.png)

### Task 1.3 : Test and Execute "Deploy to Prod" with Approval Process

In this task, you are going to find out if the approval you configured in the last task actually works!

1. Go to the [maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. Ensure you're in the **Dev** environment; if you're not, switch to it.

    ![](./assets/bs123.png)

1. Go to **Solutions (1)** in the left menu. Select the **MPPC 23 (2)** solution.

    ![](./assets/run-first-pipeline-dev(1).png)

1. Click on the **hamburger (1)** icon and then select the **Pipelines (2)** from the left.

    ![](./assets/bs124.png)

1. Earlier in this lab, you have made a Pre-Deployment Step required. That means that now, there is an info box on the deploy to prod stage **(1)**. Select the purple **Deploy here (2)** button.

    ![](./assets/bs127.png)

1. This will open a new sidebar which will give you the option to start your deployment now or plan your deployment for later. Select the purple **Next** button to go to the next screen.

    ![](./assets/bs126.png)  

1. This will lead you to the next section called **Summary**. Here you can find a bunch of info about the solution you are about to deploy to the QA environment. It also shows an AI suggested solution overview.

    - Now the AI suggested solution overview is added in the **Deployment notes (1)** box

    - Select the **Deploy (2)** button

      ![](./assets/bs128.png)

1. Next, you will see the following screen, that shows a yellow box which states that **Your request to deploy here is pending**.

    ![](./assets/bs129.png)

1. This message is showing because our changes in the beginning of the lab made sure that the **Power Automate cloud flow** is now triggered. We are working on a fresh environment, so it can take a while before the approval solution is deployed. Best is to take a break now, since it can take `5-10` minutes before your next step.

1. Open a new browser tab and go to [Outlook web](https://outlook.office.com) and wait for the approval email. After `5-10 minutes` (only the first time!) it should arrive.

1. In the approval mail you will see a couple of familiar parts:  

    - You will see the title of the **Approval (1)**  

    - You will see the **Deployment notes (2)**

    - You will see **Approve / Reject buttons (3)**, select **Approve (4)**

    - You will be able to add **Comments**, select **Approved! (5)** as comments

    - You will be able to **Submit** the approval / rejection. Select **Submit (6)**

      ![](./assets/bs130.png)      

1. Close the **Outlook** browser tab, and you will see (sometimes you have to refresh) that the deployment to production is in progress.

    ![](./assets/run-deploy-to-prod-approval-in-progress.png)

1. After the deployment is finished, you will see that the deployment is finished.

    ![](./assets/bs131.png)

And that's how the deployment with approvals works!

### Solution Checker Warning

In the meantime, you should've gotten another email.

1. Go to [Outlook web](https://outlook.office.com).

1. Look for an email with the subject **Solution checked for issues during import**.

    It should look something like this:

    ![](./assets/warn-solution-checker-prod.png)

     >**Note**: This may take a few moments to appear. In the meantime, please feel free to proceed with the next lab.
    
     This email shows there are no solution checker issues found in our solution we just deployed to production: well done!
